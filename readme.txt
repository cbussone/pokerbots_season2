Variant Strategies/Notes

We commit 6 total big blinds per hand with a 200BB stack regenerated each round
This is another zero sum game, make sure we are check folding when we're winning by 6*num_hands_left+1

We choose preflop which two cards to allocate to the 1,2, and 3 BB stacks. Do we always choose the best two cards for 3 or is a weighted balance more in order?
How would we execute this weighted balance?
